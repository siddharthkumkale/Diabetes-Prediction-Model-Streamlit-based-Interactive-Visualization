I undertook a project to develop a diabetes prediction model using machine learning techniques. Beginning with the acquisition of a dataset containing diverse health metrics such as pregnancies, glucose levels, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin levels, BMI, diabetes pedigree function, and age, I meticulously prepared the data by addressing missing values and standardizing numerical features. Opting for a RandomForestClassifier, I trained the model after extensive evaluation and hyperparameter tuning using grid search to optimize its predictive accuracy. Subsequently, I deployed this model as an interactive web application using Streamlit, enabling users to input their health data and obtain personalized predictions along with actionable healthcare recommendations. To enhance user interaction and understanding, I incorporated visualizations like interactive probability charts created with Plotly. This project seamlessly integrated machine learning with web development, providing a valuable tool for individuals to assess their diabetes risk and make informed decisions about their health.
